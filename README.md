ProjectGuenther
===============

![alt text] (guenther2stage2.png "Guenther after his first getting built session")

Guenther is my last try to keep a plant alive. For this I built some Raspberry Pi construction which is able to control power sockets over the air on 433mhz.

Because of an growing amount of Guenthers features and some things I do over and over again, I want a place where all of the features Guenther uses come together. Please stay tuned for less mistakes in my english and more code to come.
